# Variables and Mutability Challenges

This set of challenges corresponds to Chapter three of the Rust documentation. For more detailed explanations, refer to the [Rust Book - Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html).

## Challenge Description

Create a Rust program that calculates the area of a rectangle. This program should exhibit the following features:

1. **User Input:** Allow users to input the length and width of the rectangle.
2. **Flexible Calculation:** Utilize variables to represent the length and width, making the program flexible for different rectangle dimensions.
3. **Constants Usage:** Use constants to store the conversion factor for square meters (1 square meter = 10.764 square feet).
4. **Display Results:** Display the calculated area in both square feet and square meters.
5. **Shadowing:** Implement shadowing to update either the length or width by adding 1 to each.

## Getting Started

To run the program:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   cargo run
